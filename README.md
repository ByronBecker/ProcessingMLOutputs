# ProcessingMLOutputs
By Byron Becker, Maggie Patton, and Urban Martin

### Inspiration

We wrote this code to be able to use the Wekinator to classfiy people's voices. I originally wanted to know if I could do good enough impersonations to trick the algorithm ... it's harder than it looks.

### About the Program

The original processing program, [Processing_TriggerText_1Classifier](http://www.wekinator.org/examples/#Processing_animation_audio) was edited to output specific pictures based on the classifications given. To change any images, just change the .jpg or .gif in lines 31-35 to that desired when training. A basic K nearest neighbors algorithm was used for classification in our example using the [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/kadenze/) software. For more than 5 classifiable images, change the 5 in line 14 to exhibit this change. Have fun!
